# Kodi-Fan-Control
With this service plugin you can control a fan to cool down the Raspberry Pi with two diffrent speeds.
The temperatures for the speeds can be select in °Celsius.
Also the control pins for the transistors and the time for temerature check can be selected.

When you change the pins please restart the service to initialize the pins.

To use this service, you have to realise also the hardware part.
For that you need:
2 Transistor BC639( or equal)
2 Transistor B640( or equal)
2 Resistor 1k Ω
2 Resistor 169 Ω
1 Diode
1 Fan 5V

Please check out the circuit diagram for wiring.
If you use other transistors, adjust the values of the resistors accordingly!
